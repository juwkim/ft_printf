## 💡 About the project

> _The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that??
It is actually pretty cool :)._

    You will discover a popular and versatile C function: printf().
    This exercise is a great opportunity to improve your programming skills. It is of moderate difficulty.
    You will discover variadic functions in C.
    The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and extensible code.

For more detailed information, look at the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/juwkim/42cursus/blob/main/Subject%20PDFs/01_ft_printf.pdf).
