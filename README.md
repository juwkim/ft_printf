## üí° About the project

> _The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that??
It is actually pretty cool :)._

    You will discover a popular and versatile C function: printf().
    This exercise is a great opportunity to improve your programming skills. It is of moderate difficulty.
    You will discover variadic functions in C.
    The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and extensible code.

For more detailed information, look at the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/juwkim/42cursus/blob/main/Subject%20PDFs/01_ft_printf.pdf).

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

The library is written in C language and thus needs the **`c` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile the library, go to its path and run:

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Cleaning all object files (.o) and executable files (.a)**

```shell
$ make fclean
```

**3. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "ft_printf.h"
```
